# Project "Tic-Tac-Toe"

## Description

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple console-based game where two players can enjoy a classic match of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game allows players to choose their field size (e.g., 3x3, 6x6), select their characters (X or O), and take turns placing their symbols on the board. The project is written in Python and focuses on basic game logic, user input handling, and a clear display of the game field.

## âœ¨ Features and Capabilities

- **Customizable Field Size** â€” Players can choose the dimensions of the game field (up to 6x6) for a tailored experience.
- **Character Selection** â€” Each player can pick their symbol (X or O) to personalize their gameplay.
- **Interactive Gameplay** â€” Players input their moves by specifying the column and row where they'd like to place their symbol.
- **Error Handling** â€” Prevents invalid inputs like choosing the same character for both players or selecting non-existent characters.
- **Clear Display** â€” The game field is printed after each move, making it easy to follow the gameâ€™s progress.
